**Additional Information:** ISAM Utils provides a convenient way to run the Synergex ISAM utilities with all their options available (as of the creation of this code) to the user in a familiar Windows interface application.
The submission also has the project built into an executable (ISAMUtils.exe) so that the utility may be utilized without building the source.
